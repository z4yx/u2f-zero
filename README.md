U2F Zero
========

U2F Zero is an open source U2F token for 2 factor authentication.  It is implemented securely.  It works with Google accounts, Github, Duo, and anything else supporting U2F.  The latest version uses key derivation and has no limit on registrations.

You can easily [build your own](https://github.com/conorpp/u2f-zero/wiki/Building-a-U2F-Token).  You just need to order the 
[8 SMT parts](https://github.com/conorpp/u2f-zero/wiki/Parts-List#smt-parts), [$1.13-$3.5 per PCB](https://github.com/conorpp/u2f-zero/wiki/Parts-List#pcbs), and [programmer](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/silicon-labs/DEBUGADPTR1-USB/336-1182-ND/807653).
It ends up being $35 for programmer and ~$5/board.  The token should be durable enough to survive on a key chain for years, even after going through the wash.

Security Overview
-----------------

The security level is about the same as a modern car key.  Any secret information cannot be read or duplicated.  A true random number generator is used to create unpredictable keys.  

However, side channel leakage is an unsolved problem in industry and academia.  So for well equipped adversaries that can make targetted attacks and get physical access, secret information leakage is possible.  Any other hardware token that claims it's "impenetrable" or otherwise totally secure is *still* vulnerable to physical side channels and it's important to acknowledge.  However, most people don't worry about targeted attacks from well equipped adversaries.
